## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
    Why its crucial:
    - Ensure client satisfaction
    - Avoid Cost overruns 
    - Avoid Missing opportunities 
    - Protect from reputation damage

    How to ensure deadline are met:
    - Realistic planning 
    - Effective communication 
    - Apply agile methodology 
    - Effective resource management 
    - Monitoring and control
    
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
      Effective cost control contributes to the success of a software project in the following ways:
      
      - Helps prevent budget overruns
      - Improves project profitability
      - Helsp Optimize resource allocation

    Strategies to prevent budget overruns:

      - Use historical data, industry benchmarks, and expert judgment to ensure accurate estimation of costs. 
      - Monitoring and tracking regularly 
      - Identify potential risks and come up with mitigation strategies
      - Having efffective change management strategies
      - Regular review of the costs
      - Value-based prioritization
      - Effective negotiation with vendors
      
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
    Waterfall Methodology follows a sequential approach, where each phase of the project is completed in order before moving on to the next whereas Agile Methodology, adopts an iterative and incremental approach, where projects are divided into smaller iterations each delivering a working product increment. 
    
    Advantages of Waterfall Methodology

    - Has clear project structure and phases.
    - Can predict timelines

    Disadvantages:

    - Less flexible to changes. 
    - not easy to test parts until the project is complete

    Agile Methodology

    Advantages:

    -More flexible to change
    - Increased customer satisfaction due to frequent feedback

    Disadvantages:
    -
    - May not be easy to predict timelines
    - Requires effective collaboration
    
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

    - Agile is more beneficial for projects with evolving requirements, complex projects that can be broken down into parts. eg in software development.

    - Waterfall is more suited to projects where the requirements are well defined  and the scope well understood by the parties. eg in infrastructure projects.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
      Methods to ensure quality assurance
      - Testing
      - Code Review
      - Continuous Integration 
      - Version Controlto track changes in code
     - testing Usability Testing
     - Identifying and mitigating risks.

    Importance:
    - To ensure customer satisfaction
    - To enhance brand reputation 
     - To optimize resource utilization 
     - to ensure compliance with industry standards.
     - 
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

  Defining project scope ensures that the project's objectives, deliverables, and boundaries are well outlined. Parties involved are well aware of what is expected, resources are well allocated and parties are aware of the timelines.

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller and more manageable task and provides a visual representation of the project's scope.

A WBS is useful in that it promotes effective resource allocation, progress tracking of the project, communication between project stakeholders, facilitates collaboration and also helps in task identification.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
 A detailed project schedule provides a clear roadmap for the project, outlining tasks, timelines, dependencies, and resources.

- Ensures effective time management
- promotes decision making
- promotes proper allocation of resources
- helps wth task prioritization.

- Gantt are important for visualizing project schedules. the clear visual representation of timelines and schedules ensure parties are well aware of the timelines for the project, potential challenges are easily identified, resources can be allocated accordingly, the progress of the project can be tracked and helps all parties involved to plan the project effectively.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
    -inefficiency and delays, people wait a long time to receive typed proceedings leading to delayed justice and that is also used as an avenue for solicitation for bribes. backlog of cases.

    -if this wait time is reduced, case backlogs will be reduced. avenues of corruption will reduce. parties will have their cases settled in a timely manner.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

Clearly defining the problem can help the developer come up with a Focused Solution aimed at addressing the problem highlighted.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
    - creating a software to transcribe court sessions will ensure that there exists clear and readable records of cases in court. the software will also ensure that parties get typed proceedings in the shortest time possible as court sessions will be recorded and transcribed in real time. The handwriting of judicial officers can sometimes lead to loss of information and inaccuracies which the software will solve.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
    - while other transcription softwares exists, this one will be different in that it will be tailored specifically to be used in court sessions to type out the speech as it happens in court. Potentially it will also be able to recognize and transcribe local languages.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
    _There are hundreds of courts in Kenya which would need to use this software and even more courts keep being opened over time. The need for the software will therefore rise steadily as it is adopted in the different courts.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
    -understanding the trends and advancements made by other transcribing software would help in the development of the app especially on how to capture local languages in Kenya and also to possibly have the software used in other sectors other than courts.
